# U.S.Insurance cost analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a CSV file containing medical insurance costs using Python. The objective is to gain insights into the dataset, such as the average age of patients, the distribution of males and females, geographical locations of patients, average yearly medical charges, and more.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis, ensure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries. The project relies on the `csv` library, a standard library in Python.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs for medical insurance cost analysis.
